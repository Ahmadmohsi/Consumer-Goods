🔍 **Project Overview:**
In this project, I dived into the world of databases, using the power trio of **MySQL** for querying, **Power BI** for data visualization, and **PowerPoint** to present key insights.

🛠️ **Tools Used:**
1️⃣ **MySQL:** Unleashed the power of SQL with techniques like Subqueries, Multiple joins, CTE, and Window functions to extract meaningful insights.

2️⃣ **Power BI:** Transformed raw data into compelling visuals, bringing the numbers to life and making trends crystal clear.

3️⃣ **PowerPoint:** Crafted a compelling narrative, leveraging various features to deliver a presentation that not only informs but captivates.

🎓 **Key Learnings:**
From mastering intricate SQL concepts to exploring the depths of PowerPoint, this project was a masterclass in practical application. 
Huge shoutout to Dhaval Patel, Hemanand Vadivel, and the entire Codebasics community for curating projects that translate into real-world skills.

🙌 **Gratitude:**
Special thanks to NAVEEN S, Kirandeep.
